> ravendb-demo
This repository purpose is to highlight three of RavenDB's most impressive and differentiating features rather than other database products.

## Intro

Welcome to this repository that will demonstrate how easy and amazing is to connect and use RavenDB into a .net 9.0 c#  Web API application.
My goal here, is to bring the ease of use to achieve fantastic results on application features in an effortless code base.

You'll be able to experience how fast we can create an application with high performance and efficiency, both on coding and runtime results.

## Watch it

I've published a recording that brings the experience a little deeper while I dive into the code to explain what I've done to create it.
